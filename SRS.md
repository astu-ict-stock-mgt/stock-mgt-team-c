ABSTRACT

The Stock Management System is a web-based application designed to automate and improve inventory management activities within an organization. The system aims to replace traditional manual procedures with a computerized solution that increases efficiency, accuracy, transparency, and accountability in stock administration.

The existing inventory management process relies heavily on paper-based records, bin cards, stock record cards, and manual calculations. These methods are time-consuming and susceptible to human errors, data loss, stock shortages, overstocking, and delays in report generation. To address these challenges, the proposed system provides an integrated platform for managing inventory operations.

The system includes modules for user management, supplier management, stock classification, stock receiving, stock issuing, stock transfer, stock tracking, stock valuation, stock taking, report generation, and audit logging. The system also supports inventory valuation using the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method and implements role-based access control to ensure data security.

The project follows the Agile software development methodology, which includes requirement gathering, system analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Modern technologies such as React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL will be used to develop the application.

The proposed Stock Management System is expected to reduce paperwork, minimize operational costs, improve decision-making, and provide real-time inventory information. Ultimately, the system will enhance the effectiveness of inventory management and contribute to better organizational performance.

Chapter One

Introduction

1.1 Background

Inventory management plays a vital role in the daily operations of organizations such as government institutions, universities, hospitals, warehouses, and private companies. Every organization depends on materials, equipment, and supplies to carry out its activities efficiently. Therefore, proper management of these resources is essential to ensure their availability whenever they are needed.

Traditionally, many organizations manage their inventories using manual methods such as paper records, stock cards, bin cards, and handwritten reports. Although these methods have been used for many years, they are time-consuming, difficult to maintain, and highly vulnerable to human errors. Problems such as loss of records, inaccurate calculations, stock shortages, overstocking, and delayed reporting frequently occur in manual systems.

With the advancement of information technology, computerized inventory management systems have become an effective solution for managing stock operations. A Stock Management System automates activities such as stock receiving, stock issuing, stock tracking, stock valuation, stock taking, report generation, and inventory control.

The proposed Stock Management System is a web-based application designed to improve inventory management by providing accurate, secure, and real-time information about stock movement and availability. The system will reduce paperwork, improve operational efficiency, and support effective decision-making.

1.2 Statement of the Problem

Many organizations still use traditional methods to manage their inventory. These methods create several operational challenges that negatively affect organizational performance.

The major problems of the existing system include:

Difficulty in tracking stock movement.

Human errors during data recording.

Loss and duplication of inventory records.

Delays in report generation.

Overstocking and stock shortages.

Inaccurate inventory valuation.

Poor monitoring of damaged and obsolete items.

Lack of transparency and accountability.

Limited access to real-time inventory information.

Difficulty in conducting stock taking and reconciliation.

Because of these problems, organizations require a computerized solution that can automate inventory management activities and improve the efficiency and reliability of inventory operations.

1.3 Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a web-based Stock Management System that automates inventory management processes and improves the overall efficiency of stock administration.

The system aims to provide a centralized platform for managing inventory operations, including stock receiving, stock issuing, stock classification, stock tracking, stock valuation, stock taking, and report generation.

The project also aims to minimize manual work, reduce human errors, improve transparency, and provide accurate and real-time inventory information.

1.4 Objective

1.4.1 General Objective

To design and develop a computerized Stock Management System that automates inventory management activities and improves operational efficiency.

1.4.2 Specific Objectives

The specific objectives of the project are:

To develop a secure authentication and authorization system.

To manage inventory categories and item codes.

To register suppliers and manage supplier information.

To record stock receipts and stock issues.

To maintain bin cards and stock records.

To implement FIFO inventory valuation.

To monitor reorder levels and safety stock.

To automate stock taking and reconciliation.

To generate inventory reports and analytics.

To manage damaged and obsolete stock.

To maintain audit logs and activity records.

1.5 Feasibility Study

A feasibility study was conducted to determine whether the proposed Stock Management System is technically, economically, operationally, and schedule-wise feasible.

1.5.1 Technical Feasibility

The proposed system can be developed using modern technologies such as:

Frontend: React.js or Next.js

Backend: Node.js and Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL

API: REST API

Version Control: Git and GitHub

The development tools and technologies are widely available and suitable for the implementation of the project.

1.5.2 Economic Feasibility

The project is economically feasible. The estimated development cost is 12,000 ETB (as detailed in the cost schedule). This cost is relatively low compared to the long-term benefits. The system is expected to reduce paperwork, minimize inventory losses caused by errors and poor tracking, decrease time spent on stock taking and report generation, and improve overall operational efficiency. The cost of continuing with the current manual system (including losses from stock shortages, overstocking, and delayed decision-making) is significantly higher than the investment required for the computerized system.

1.5.3 Operational Feasibility

The system is operationally feasible. It is designed to be user-friendly so that storekeepers, stock clerks, the Property Administration Officer, accountants, and department heads can use it with minimal training. The system supports the existing organizational workflow rather than completely changing it. Management support and the clear need to solve current inventory problems increase the likelihood of successful adoption. Resistance to change will be managed through training and gradual transition from the paper-based system.

1.5.4 Schedule Feasibility

The project is schedule-feasible. According to the planned task schedule, the total development period is approximately 13 weeks (requirement gathering – 1 week, analysis – 1 week, design – 2 weeks, database design – 1 week, implementation – 4 weeks, testing – 2 weeks, deployment – 1 week, and documentation – 1 week). This timeline is realistic given the scope of the system and the available team resources. Potential delays (such as late feedback from stakeholders) will be managed through regular communication and prioritization of core features.

Chapter Two

Overall Description of the Existing System

2.1 Description of the Existing System

The existing inventory management system is primarily based on manual procedures and paper-based documentation. Different departments request materials from the store by filling out requisition forms, while storekeepers record stock movements using bin cards, stock record cards, and other physical documents.

The system involves several activities, including stock receiving, inspection, storage, issuing, dispatching, stock taking, and report preparation. Most of these activities are performed manually, which requires significant time and effort.

When goods arrive at the warehouse, they are inspected and recorded in stock registers. Likewise, when a department requests materials, the request must be approved by the responsible authority before the items are issued. All transactions are documented using paper forms.

Although the current system provides basic inventory management functions, it lacks automation, real-time monitoring, and efficient reporting mechanisms.

2.2 Major Functions of the Existing System

The existing system performs the following major functions:

Registration of inventory items.

Classification and coding of stock items.

Receiving and inspection of goods.

Storage and arrangement of inventory.

Issuing materials to departments.

Dispatching materials outside the organization.

Recording stock movement using bin cards.

Maintaining stock record cards.

Conducting stock taking and reconciliation.

Preparing inventory reports.

Managing damaged and obsolete items.

Monitoring minimum and maximum stock levels.

2.3 Users of the Current System

The current inventory system involves different actors who perform different responsibilities.

Property Administration Officer (PAO)

The Property Administration Officer supervises all inventory activities and approves stock requests, stock transfers, and inventory reports.

Storekeeper

The storekeeper receives, stores, issues, and safeguards inventory items. The storekeeper also updates bin cards and maintains warehouse records.

Stock Clerk

The stock clerk maintains stock records, updates inventory transactions, and prepares reports.

Department Head

Lack of real-time updates.

Because of these limitations, organizations face operational inefficiencies and inventory management challenges.

2.5 Business Rules

Business rules define the policies and constraints that govern inventory operations.

The following business rules apply to the existing system:

Every inventory item must have a unique item code.

All received goods must be inspected before being stored.

Only authorized personnel can approve inventory transactions.

Inventory cannot be issued without an approved requisition form.

Every inventory transaction must be recorded.

Every stock item must have a corresponding bin card and stock record card.

Stock records must be updated whenever goods are received or issued.

Inventory valuation must follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

Physical stock taking must be conducted at least once every fiscal year.

Damaged and obsolete items must be identified and reported.

Materials leaving the organization must be accompanied by an authorized gate pass.

Stock discrepancies must be investigated and corrected.

Users are responsible for materials issued to their departments.

Reorder levels and safety stock must be maintained to avoid stock shortages.
